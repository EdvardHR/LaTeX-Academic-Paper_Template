\addappendix %Set the file types for correct numbering etc.
%Order files for the appendix here. 

%I strongly suggests to orderer every apendixfile (e.g sample_python_code) as its own inputfile or group of input files (as shown in sample_python)
%This increases the appendix' readability as well as making the appendix more robust when trying to keep certain files together. 
%I also makes it easier to change the order later into the prosject.
